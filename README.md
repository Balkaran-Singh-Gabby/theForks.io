## Winnipeg Open Source Showcase

Welcome! This is a **community-driven repository** where Winnipeg (and Manitoba) developers can share small open-source programs, scripts, and projects.

Whether youâ€™ve built a handy CLI tool, a small web app, or just a fun experiment, we want to showcase it here! 
Let's see how creative this can get!
