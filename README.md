## Winnipeg Open Source Showcase

Hello Winnipeg!
Welcome to TheForks.io

Winnipeg is home to a robust tech scene that is beginning to evolve in new and exciting ways. The Forks historical site embodies a spirit of teamwork and communication. TheForks.io is for Manitoban programmers, developers, and designers to share, discover, and discuss local open-source programs and projects.

Whether you’ve built a handy CLI tool, a small web app, or just a fun experiment, we want to showcase it here!

## Specifics

My name is [Dave Sommerville](https://ds-code.ca) and I'm a recent graduate from [MITT](https://mitt.ca). I'm currently the sole moderator for this repo, but I want to change that. Once I get things established, I will share permissions with a select group of people to ensure integrity and longevity for the project. In the meantime, I will handle all contributions to the best of my ability. 







#### This space is for programmers of all experience levels.



Whether you’re new to Git or a senior developer, if you have one or two **original** open source projects you’re proud of and want to share with a local audience, you’re in the right place. For the foreseeable future, contributors will be limited to two projects to share. You are able to replace, update, or remove those programs as you wish of course. Projects that are the result of school assignments should not be submitted, as they aren't technically original and the schools will likely want to reuse the project ideas. Please note the Code of Conduct and the Contribution guide below 

#### **Why Contribute?**

By adding your project, you get:

⦁	Visibility — Your work is showcased alongside other local devs.

⦁	Portfolio Material — Link to your project in job applications or resumes.

⦁	Networking — Connect with other Winnipeg developers.

⦁	Git \& Open Source Practice — Learn pull requests, forks, branching, and reviewing code.

⦁	Community Impact — Inspire others to learn and build.



**Please note:** This is NOT a space for selling products or yourself. Programs offered here are meant for community engagement. Let your work speak for itself. 



#### **Please share with the developers in your circle**

We can turn this into something awesome, but we can only do that if we share it with others. If you have any Manitoban programmers, developers, web/app designers, or general tech enthusiasts in your circles, please send this repo their way.
